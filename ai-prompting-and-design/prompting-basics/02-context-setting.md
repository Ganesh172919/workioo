# Context-Setting Techniques

## Why Context Matters
Context is the background information that helps AI understand your situation, goals, and constraints. Without proper context, even clear prompts can produce irrelevant results.

## Essential Context Elements

### 1. **Your Role or Situation**
Tell the AI who you are and what you're trying to achieve.

**Example:**
```
"I'm a small business owner with no technical background. I need to..."
"I'm a high school student preparing for exams. Can you..."
"As a senior developer reviewing code, I want to..."
```

### 2. **Your Goal or Purpose**
Explain what you want to accomplish with the information.

**Example:**
```
"I need to explain this concept to my team in a presentation..."
"I'm writing a blog post for beginners about..."
"I'm debugging an issue and need to understand..."
```

### 3. **Your Constraints**
Mention limitations like time, resources, or expertise level.

**Example:**
```
"I have 30 minutes to learn the basics of..."
"I need a solution that doesn't require expensive tools..."
"I can only use vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks..."
```

### 4. **Prior Attempts or Knowledge**
Share what you've already tried or know.

**Example:**
```
"I've read about X and Y, but I'm confused about Z..."
"I tried this approach but got this error..."
"I understand the basics but need help with advanced concepts..."
```

## Context-Setting Templates

### Template 1: Learning Context
```
"I'm a [skill level] learning [topic]. 
I understand [what you know] but struggle with [specific challenge].
I learn best through [learning style].
Can you [specific request]?"
```

### Template 2: Problem-Solving Context
```
"I'm working on [project/task] using [tools/technologies].
I'm trying to [goal] but encountered [problem].
I've already tried [previous attempts].
Can you suggest [specific help needed]?"
```

### Template 3: Creation Context
```
"I need to create [output] for [audience].
The purpose is [goal/intention].
It should be [format/style/length].
Key points to cover: [list].
Can you help me [specific request]?"
```

## Before and After Examples

### Example 1: Technical Help

**❌ Without Context:**
"How do I optimize my database?"

**✅ With Context:**
"I'm running a PostgreSQL database for an e-commerce site with 100K users. Query times have increased from 200ms to 3 seconds over the past month. I've already added basic indexes on user_id and product_id. What optimization strategies should I explore next?"

### Example 2: Learning Request

**❌ Without Context:**
"Teach me about machine learning"

**✅ With Context:**
"I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience in Python. I understand basic statistics but haven't worked with ML before. I want to build a recommendation system for my project. Can you explain the basics of collaborative filtering in simple terms with a code example?"

### Example 3: Creative Task

**❌ Without Context:**
"Write an email"

**✅ With Context:**
"I need to write a professional email to a client who's unhappy about a 2-week project delay. The delay was due to unexpected technical issues that we've now resolved. I want to apologize, explain the situation briefly, reassure them of quality, and propose a revised timeline. Tone should be professional but warm."

## Practice Tasks

**Exercise 1:** Add context to this prompt:
"Explain blockchain"

Include:
- Your technical background
- Why you need to understand it
- What level of detail you need
- What you'll use this knowledge for

**Exercise 2:** Create a well-contextualized prompt for one of these scenarios:
1. Asking for recipe recommendations
2. Getting career advice
3. Learning a new programming language
4. Planning a vacation

**Exercise 3:** Review one of your recent AI conversations. Identify where additional context could have improved the responses.

## Common Context Mistakes

1. **TMI (Too Much Information)**: Include relevant details only
   - ❌ "I'm 25, from Chicago, like pizza, studied engineering..."
   - ✅ "I'm an engineering graduate transitioning to data science..."

2. **Hidden assumptions**: Don't assume the AI knows your previous conversations
   - ❌ "As we discussed earlier..."
   - ✅ Always restate important context in new conversations

3. **Missing critical details**: Don't leave out crucial constraints
   - ❌ "Suggest a solution"
   - ✅ "Suggest a free, open-source solution that works on Windows"

## Quick Context Checklist

Before submitting a prompt, ask yourself:
- [ ] Have I stated my role or background?
- [ ] Is my goal clear?
- [ ] Have I mentioned important constraints?
- [ ] Did I share relevant prior knowledge or attempts?
- [ ] Is this enough context without being overwhelming?

## Key Takeaways

✓ Context transforms generic answers into tailored solutions  
✓ Include who you are, what you need, and why  
✓ Mention constraints and prior attempts  
✓ Balance detail with conciseness  
✓ Update context when switching topics
