# Core Prompting Principles

## Introduction
Effective prompting is the foundation of productive AI interactions. Understanding core principles helps you communicate clearly with AI systems and get better results.

## The Five Core Principles

### 1. **Be Clear and Specific**
AI systems work best with explicit instructions. Vague prompts lead to vague answers.

**Example:**
- ❌ Poor: "Tell me about dogs"
- ✅ Good: "Explain three key differences between Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers in terms of temperament, size, and grooming needs"

### 2. **Provide Context**
Help the AI understand the background and purpose of your request.

**Example:**
- ❌ Poor: "How do I fix this?"
- ✅ Good: "I'm a beginner programmer learning Python. My code throws a 'list index out of range' error. How can I fix it and prevent it in the future?"

### 3. **Break Down Complex Tasks**
Divide large requests into smaller, manageable steps.

**Example:**
- ❌ Poor: "Build me a website"
- ✅ Good: "First, help me create a simple HTML structure for a portfolio website with a header, about section, and contact form"

### 4. **Specify the Desired Format**
Tell the AI how you want the information presented.

**Example:**
- ❌ Poor: "Explain photosynthesis"
- ✅ Good: "Explain photosynthesis using a numbered list with 5 simple steps, suitable for a 10-year-old"

### 5. **Iterate and Refine**
Don't expect perfection on the first try. Follow up and clarify as needed.

**Example:**
- First prompt: "Explain quantum computing"
- Follow-up: "Can you simplify that explanation and focus only on how qubits differ from regular bits?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague**: "Tell me something interesting" → Specify what topics interest you
2. **Assuming prior knowledge**: Always provide necessary context
3. **Multiple unrelated questions**: Focus on one topic at a time
4. **Ignoring the AI's format**: Structure your prompts well for better responses

## Practice Task

**Exercise 1:** Improve this poor prompt:
"Write about climate"

**Your improved version should:**
- Specify what aspect of climate
- Define the audience or purpose
- Indicate desired length or format

**Exercise 2:** Create a prompt asking for help learning a new skill (e.g., cooking, guitar, coding) that includes:
- Your current skill level
- Your specific goal
- Preferred learning style
- Time constraints

## Key Takeaways

✓ Clarity beats brevity  
✓ Context improves accuracy  
✓ Structure your requests  
✓ Specify output format  
✓ Iterate to improve  

## Next Steps
Move on to learning about context-setting techniques to provide even better background information for your prompts.
